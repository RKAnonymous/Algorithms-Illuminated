1. Karatsuba Algorithm

Input: two n-digit positive integers x and y.
Output: the product x · y.
Assumption: n is a power of 2.
    if n = 1 then
        // base case
        compute x · y in one step and return the result
    else
        // recursive case
        a, b := first and second halves of x
        c, d := first and second halves of y
        compute p := a + b and q := c + d using grade-school addition
        recursively compute ac := a · c, bd := b · d, and pq := p · q
        compute adbc := pq ac bd using grade-school addition
        compute 10 n · ac + 10 n/2 · adbc + bd using grade-school addition and return the result
