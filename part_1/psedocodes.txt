1. Karatsuba Algorithm

Input: two n-digit positive integers x and y.
Output: the product x · y.
Assumption: n is a power of 2.
    if n = 1 then
        // base case
        compute x · y in one step and return the result
    else
        // recursive case
        a, b := first and second halves of x
        c, d := first and second halves of y
        compute p := a + b and q := c + d using grade-school addition
        recursively compute ac := a · c, bd := b · d, and pq := p · q
        compute adbc := pq ac bd using grade-school addition
        compute 10 n · ac + 10 n/2 · adbc + bd using grade-school addition and return the result


2. MergeSort Algorithm

Input: array A of n distinct integers.
Output: array with the same integers, sorted from smallest to largest.

    base case: if array length smaller than 2 return array

    C := recursively sort first half of A
    D := recursively sort second half of A
    return Merge (C,D)

    2.1 Merge Algorithm

    Input: sorted arrays C and D (length n/2 each).
    Output: sorted array B (length n).
    Simplifying assumption: n is even.

        Initialize i and j index variables for C and D arrays, result array
        while B size is smaller than the sum of C and B sizes
            if item of C array at i is lower than the item of D at j
                append C[i] item to result
                increment i by 1
            else:
                append D[j] item to result
                increment j by 1

            if the end either array is reached,
            add the remaining elements of the other array to the result

        return the result
